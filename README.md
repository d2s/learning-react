# Learning React

This is a learning experiment for practicing [React](https://reactjs.org/) related skills.

## Features

- `components` structure for more clear starting point.
- Examples of how to use Jest based testing tools.
  - ReactDOM for testing component with sub-components
  - Enzyme-based shallow component rendering
  - Jest Snapshot testing for looking at the output of a component.
- [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) CSS visual style library for improved productivity.
  - Tachyons integration to React was partially based on a 3rd party [documentation](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons-and-react) (even while that guide was a bit outdated).
- _More to comeâ€¦_
